Completed the landing page!

Some glaring issues:

Zooming out causes the contents to bunch at the top. This is due to me not using flex: 1 for some of the components to allow them to fill the screen

Margins are hard-coded, the components aren't perfectly aligned vertically. Could potentially fix by splitting up the components into containers differently?

When minimizing the screen (inward/horizontally), it loses form at smaller sizes. Could potentially fix with min-width? Maybe flex-wrap?

Overall, my project seems to function as desired at least for a beginner project.
